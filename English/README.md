## 📌 Intended Use Cases

- When you only want to post meeting highlights to Slack or Notion  
- When you don't have time to compile meeting minutes  
- When you need to quickly share ToDos with your team

---

## 🧾 Development Background

This GPT was developed based on knowledge from Microsoft's certified “Boosting Productivity with Generative AI” course,  
to reduce the burden of “summarizing, sharing, and issuing instructions” in actual meeting settings.  
It addresses real-world feedback like “No time to review meeting minutes” or “Just want to see the to-dos.”

💡 Before implementation, minutes took 30 minutes to write. Now, you can post them to Slack in just 3 minutes.
